## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
npm i

## Usage
After all the packages have been installed run the 'node server.js" command in the terminal after right-clicking on the server.js file. The server will then start to run which you can find by typing localhost:3001 into your browser. After pressing 'Get Started', type in your desired Note Title & Note Text into the website. The trash can icon deletes previous notes. The plus symbol creates a new note entirely & the floppy disk icon saves the note.
